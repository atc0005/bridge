## Project home

See [our GitHub repo][repo-url] for the latest code, to file an issue or
submit improvements for review and potential inclusion into the project.

## Overview

1. Generate report
   - Find duplicate files and report them via console-only output or an output
     CSV file
1. Remove flagged files
   - Process CSV file report generated earlier: if flag is set,
     (optionally) backup and then remove marked files

### Generate report

Generating a report is the first step towards indicating which files from a
duplicate file set that you wish to remove (specified explicitly) and which
you wish to keep (default behavior).

### Prune duplicate files

Pruning duplicate files is an optional second step following the generation of
a duplicate files report (via the `report` subcommand).

You first open the CSV file using an application like Microsoft Excel or
LibreOffice Calc and then mark each file (`remove_file` column) that you wish
to remove with either `true` or `false`; the default is `false`, so marking an
entry with `false` is not strictly necessary.

Once marked, you are then able to remove those files by specifying the full
path to the CSV file (via the `prune` subcommand). See the
[Examples](#examples) section for details.

## Features

- Efficient evaluation of potential duplicates by limiting checksum generation
  to two or more identically sized files
- Support for creating CSV report of all duplicate file matches
- Support for generating (rough) console equivalent of CSV file for
  (potential) quick review
- Support for creating Microsoft Excel workbook of all duplicate file matches
- Support for evaluating one or many paths
- Recursive or shallow directory evaluation
- Optional removal of (user-flagged) duplicate files from a previously
  generated CSV report
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Requirements

The following is a loose guideline. Other combinations of Go and operating
systems for building and running tools from this repo may work, but have not
been tested.

### Building source code

- Go
  - see this project's `go.mod` file for *preferred* version
  - this project tests against [officially supported Go
    releases][go-supported-releases]
    - the most recent stable release (aka, "stable")
    - the prior, but still supported release (aka, "oldstable")
- GCC
  - if building with custom options (as the provided `Makefile` does)
- `make`
  - if using the provided `Makefile`

### Running

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu Linux 18.04+

## Installation

### From source

1. [Download][go-docs-download] Go
1. [Install][go-docs-install] Go
1. Clone the repo
   1. `cd /tmp`
   1. `git clone https://github.com/atc0005/bridge`
   1. `cd bridge`
1. Install dependencies (optional)
   - for Ubuntu Linux
     - `sudo apt-get install make gcc`
   - for CentOS Linux
     1. `sudo yum install make gcc`
1. Build
   - for current operating system
     - `go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/bridge/`
       - *forces build to use bundled dependencies in top-level `vendor`
         folder*
   - for all supported platforms (where `make` is installed)
      - `make all`
   - for Windows
      - `make windows`
   - for Linux
     - `make linux`
1. Copy the applicable binary to whatever systems needs to run it
   - if using `Makefile`: look in `/tmp/release_assets/bridge/`
   - if using `go build`: look in `/tmp/bridge/`

### Using release binaries

1. Download the [latest release][repo-url] binaries
1. Deploy
   - Place `bridge` in a location of your choice
     - e.g., `/usr/local/bin/bridge`

## Examples

### Generating a report

#### Single path, recursive

This example illustrates using the application to process a single path,
recursively.

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe report -recurse -path "/tmp/path1" -csvfile "path1-report.csv"
```

#### Multiple paths, non-recursive

This example illustrates using the application to process multiple paths,
without recursively evaluating any subdirectories.

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe report -path "/tmp/path1" -path "/tmp/path2"  -csvfile "report.csv"
```

#### Invalid flag

Accidentally typing the wrong flag results in a message like this one:

```ShellSession
$ ./bridge.exe report -fake-flag
DEBUG: subcommand 'report'
flag provided but not defined: -fake-flag

bridge x.y.z
https://github.com/atc0005/bridge

Usage of "bridge report":
  -console
        Dump (approximate) CSV file equivalent to console.
  -csvfile string
        The (required) fully-qualified path to a CSV file that this application should generate.
  -duplicates int
        Number of files of the same file size needed before duplicate validation logic is applied. (default 2)
  -excelfile string
        The (optional) fully-qualified path to an Excel file that this application should generate.
  -ignore-errors
        Ignore minor errors whenever possible. This option does not affect handling of fatal errors such as failure to generate output report files.
  -path value
        Path to process. This flag may be repeated for each additional path to evaluate.
  -recurse
        Perform recursive search into subdirectories per provided path.
  -size int
        File size limit (in bytes) for evaluation. Files smaller than this will be skipped. (default 1)
DEBUG: err returned from reportCmd.Parse(): flag provided but not defined: -fake-flag

ERROR: flag provided but not defined: -fake-flag
```

### Pruning duplicate files

#### Dry-run (minimal)

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe prune -input-csvfile "report.csv" -dry-run -ignore-errors
```

Here we specify:

- Don't actually remove files, just simulate the process
- input CSV file (file previously generated by the `report` subcommand)
- ignore (minor) errors

Because the `console` flag wasn't specified, the output is minimal.

#### Dry-run (verbose)

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe prune -input-csvfile "report.csv" -dry-run -ignore-errors -console
```

Here we specify:

- Don't actually remove files, just simulate the process
- input CSV file (file previously generated by the `report` subcommand)
- ignore (minor) errors
- `console` flag
  - enables printing table of parsed CSV contents
  - enables printing table of file removal candidates

Because the `console` flag *was* specified, the output is more verbose.

#### Backup files before removing them

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe prune -input-csvfile "report.csv" -backup-dir /tmp/tacos -dry-run -ignore-errors -console
```

Here we specify:

- the input CSV file (file previously generated by the `report` subcommand)
- the backup directory that should be used to copy files to (just before a
  file removal operation is attempted)
- ignore (minor) errors
- `console` flag
  - enables printing table of parsed CSV contents
  - enables printing table of file removal candidates

Because the `console` flag *was* specified, the output is more verbose. This
can make the removal process easier to troubleshoot due to the explicit
listing of what *would* be removed and what actually occurred.
