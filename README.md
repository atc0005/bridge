## Project home

See [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/atc0005/bridge) for the latest
code, to file an issue or submit improvements for review and potential
inclusion into the project.

## Overview

Find duplicate files and report them for (currently manual) resolution.

## Features

- Efficient evaluation of potential duplicates by limiting checksum generation
  to two or more identically sized files
- Support for creating CSV report of all duplicate file matches
- Support for generating (rough) console equivalent of CSV file for
  (potential) quick review
- Support for creating Microsoft Excel workbook of all duplicate file matches
- Support for evaluating one or many paths
- Recursive or shallow directory evaluation
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)

## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Requirements

- Go 1.12+ (for building)
- GCC

  - if using the provided `Makefile`

Tested using:

- Go 1.13+
- Windows 10 Version 1903
  - native
  - WSL

## Configuration Options

### Command-line Arguments

| Option          | Required | Default        | Repeat | Possible                            | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h`, `help`     | No       | `false`        | No     | `0+`                                | Keep specified number of matching files.                                                                                                     |
| `console`       | No       | `false`        | No     | `true`, `false`                     | Dump CSV file equivalent to console.                                                                                                         |
| `csvfile`       | Yes      | *empty string* | No     | *valid file name characters*        | The fully-qualified path to a CSV file that this application should generate.                                                                |
| `excelfile`     | No       | *empty string* | No     | *valid file name characters*        | The fully-qualified path to a Microsoft Excel file that this application should generate.                                                    |
| `ignore-errors` | No       | `false`        | No     | `true`, `false`                     | Ignore minor errors whenever possible. This option does not affect handling of fatal errors such as failure to generate output report files. |
| `path`          | Yes      | *empty string* | Yes    | *one or more valid directory paths* | Path to process. This flag may be repeated for each additional path to evaluate.                                                             |

## Examples

### Single path, recursive

This example illustrates using the application to process a single path,
recursively.

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe -recurse -path "/tmp/path1"
```

### Multiple paths, non-recursive

This example illustrates using the application to process multiple paths,
without recursively evaluating any subdirectories.

```ShellSession
./bridge.exe -path "/tmp/path1" -path "/tmp/path2"
```

### Invalid flag

Accidentally typing the wrong flag results in a message like this one:

```ShellSession
flag provided but not defined: -fake-flag
```
