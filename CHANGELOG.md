      changed slightly to accommodate those changes

- Vendor dependencies

- Makefile
  - include `-mod=vendor` flag force builds to use new `vendor`
    top-level directory
  - replace two external shell scripts with equivalent embedded commands
  - borrow heavily from existing `Makefile` for `atc0005/elbow` project
  - dynamically determine go module path for version tag use

- Update GitHub Actions Workflows
  - Disable running `go get` after checking out code
  - Exclude `vendor` folder from ...
    - Markdown linting checks
    - tests
    - basic build
  - include `-mod=vendor` flag force builds to use new `vendor`
    top-level directory

- Linting
  - golangci-lint
    - Install and use specific binary version instead of building from  master
    - Move linters/settings to external config file
    - Enable `gofmt` linter
    - Enable `scopelint` linter
    - Enable `dogsled` linter

### Fixed

- GoDoc formatting issue due to forced line wrapping

## [v0.4.1] - 2020-03-02

### Fixed

- (GH-55) `Makefile` builds failed to set version information

## [v0.4.0] - 2020-02-27

### Added

- Add support for pruning flagged/marked items in the input CSV file (previously
  generated by the `report` subcommand)
- Split application logic (and flags) into subcommands
  - `report` for existing behavior and set of flags
  - `prune` for new behavior and new set of flags

### Changed

- GitHub Actions Workflow: `Validate Codebase`
  - `Build with default options` step updated to run `go build` against cmd
    dir path
  - Go 1.12.x removed from build matrix
  - Go 1.14.x added to build matrix
- Move related chunks of code into subpackages
  - e.g., `matches`, `paths`, ...
- Help/Usage output
  - Emit extended Help/Usage information for each subcommand
  - Emit overall summary of subcommands when binary is called without
    subcommands or with `-h` or `-help` flags
  - Emit branding details (`App Name`, `Version`, `Repo URL`)

### Fixed

- README coverage for help flags

## [v0.3.0] - 2020-02-09

### Added

- Echo Go version used in CI workflows so that it is saved in CI output logs
- Flag for duplicates threshold
- Flag for size threshold

### Fixed

- Add missing (and required) `csvfile` flag in README examples
- Add missing guard against creation of Microsoft Excel file when user did not
  request it

## [v0.2.0] - 2020-01-15

### Added

- Support for creating Microsoft Excel workbook of all duplicate file matches
- README
  - CI badges to indicate current linting and build results
  - GoDoc badge
  - Latest release badge

### Fixed

## [v0.1.1] - 2020-01-13

### Fixed

- Missing support in multiple locations for `IgnoreErrors` option

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added

This initial prototype supports/provides:

- Fast and efficient evaluation of potential duplicates by limiting checksum
  generation to two or more identically sized files
- Support for creating CSV report of duplicate file matches
- Support for generating (rough) console equivalent of CSV file for
  (potential) quick review
- Support for evaluating one or many paths
- Recursive or single-level directory evaluation

Worth noting (in no particular order):

- Command-line flags support via `flag` standard library package
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)
- GitHub Actions linting and build checks
- Makefile for general use cases
- No external, non-standard library packages
