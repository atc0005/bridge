### Fixed

- Missing support in multiple locations for `IgnoreErrors` option

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added

This initial prototype supports/provides:

- Fast and efficient evaluation of potential duplicates by limiting checksum
  generation to two or more identically sized files
- Support for creating CSV report of duplicate file matches
- Support for generating (rough) console equivalent of CSV file for
  (potential) quick review
- Support for evaluating one or many paths
- Recursive or single-level directory evaluation

Worth noting (in no particular order):

- Command-line flags support via `flag` standard library package
- Go modules (vs classic `GOPATH` setup)
- GitHub Actions linting and build checks
- Makefile for general use cases
- No external, non-standard library packages
